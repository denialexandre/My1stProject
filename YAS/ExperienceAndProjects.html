        <dt>Digital Product Lead | Santander Bank Mexico</dt>
        <dd>Mexico City, Mexico.</dd>
        <dd>February, 2022 - present day.</dd>
        <ul>
        <br>
            <li>In this position, I have organised the team so we can celebrate the delivery of 2
                successful digital products and features from scratch to production in PlayStore,
                AppStore and SamsungGalaxyStore.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                I am in constant communication with different teams in the Bank; for example, Legal,
                Risks, AML, Investments, UX/UI, Testing, etc.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> 
            According to the bank's 2022 objectives, we have planned the roadmap according to
            the most important features and the ones that are going to deliver a significant
            amount of business and economic value.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
            Since we successfully delivered the Samsung Members Wallet, last November of 2021,
            now I am on charge of new features to be delivered during this 2022 along with my
            team.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                I have to report directly to several of the Bank’s Directors in daily or weekly meetings.</li>
            </li>
            <br>

        <dt>Senior Product Owner | Santander Bank Mexico</dt>
        <dd>Mexico City, Mexico.</dd>
        <dd>January, 2021 - January, 2022.</dd>
        <ul>
        <br>
            <li>
                From over 300 hundred applicants and very difficult interviews, Santander Bank chose me. I was really grateful and committed with the Bank and the new projects I was
|               working on.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In my former role as Senior Digital Product Owner, I was on charge of four teams
                (where I was on charge of 25 persons: Developers, Scrum Masters and Product
                Owners). We had committed specific dates to achieve the roadmap goals during 2021
                and I am more than happy to share that we achieved our goals with success.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Together we developed and delivered the MVP for the Samsung Members Wallet, the
                MVP of our new Digital Accounts Lite and Pro (that new clients and already existing
                clients can request within minutes from their mobile devices), and also new features
                for our digital products.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                I had my Scrum Masters organise the Scrum Ceremonies with my four squads. I
                organized other meetings with the bank’s Governances. All these with the help of
                different Teams like, Legal, Fraud, Risk, AML, UX/UI, Testing, among others; so we
                could be able to decide business rules and determine the acceptance criteria so the
                Development team could work clearly and efficiently.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>These are some of the products I have been working on with my team:</li>

        <dt>Digital Product Manager & Certified Product Owner | Broxel</dt>
        <dd>Mexico City, Mexico.</dd>
        <dd>February, 2019 - December, 2021.</dd>
        <ul>
        <br>
            <li>Quickly I gained recognition, so one of the Directors put me on charge of the soft launch of the company’s new onboarding process for the SOFIPO. The delivery date was on February the 20th (2020) and we delivered the project on time. 
 
                On May the 15th 2021, we delivered the web onboarding process (for the SOFIPO), so the new clients could request a Broxel low risk account from a pc or any mobile device with internet access (not from the app). We prepared everything for the launch on June the 1st and I was on charge of the complete delivery. We managed a waiting list, a group conformed by friends & family tried the process and on July the 1st, the product was released on PlayStore and AppStore so any person in Mexico could download it. 
                
                All these projects implied that I had to manage six teams again; UX, Development, QA, Contact Center, Innovation and Media so we could run the necessary tests. This responsibility also involved creation of new flow charts, new user stories, epics, road maps, and participating in daily scrum meetings, sprint planning, sprint review, sprint retrospective and sprint refinement sessions. 
                
                When I was in this position, I have delivered three successful Digital Products and I have participated on the delivery on one Web-Based Software for our organization so the Broxel Digital Executives use it every day.
